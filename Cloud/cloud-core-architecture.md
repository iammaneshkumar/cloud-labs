# Cloud Core Architecture

1. Region
        1. A region is a geographic area where cloud services are hosted.
        2. It contains multiple availablility zones.

2. Avilablility Zone 
        1. An availability zone is a physically isolated dtatcenter within a region.
        2. It provides redundancy and fault tolerance within the same region.

3. Datacenter
        1. A datacenter is the smallest unit, housing the physical infrastructure like servers, storage and networking equipment.
	2. Multiple datacenters make up an availability zone.

# Region (Like Asia) -> Availability Zone (Like India,Japan) -> Datacenters (In India- Delhi, Himachal Pradesh, and In Japan- Tokyo)
